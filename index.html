                <h1>SONY VX2000</h1>
                <p>The Sony Digital Camcorder has a wide array of digital extras. In addition to the usual set of picture effects, like sepia for instance, the VX2000 also has five high-quality digital effects. There's a luminance key, for example, which allows you to key the live action over a still image in the camcorder's memory.</p>

            <h1>SKATEBOARDING HISTORY</h1>
            <p>Skateboarding was popularized by the 1986 skateboarding cult classic Thrashin'. Directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin, it features appearances from many famous skaters such as Tony Alva, Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi and Steve Caballero. Thrashin' also had a direct impact on Lords of Dogtown, as Catherine Hardwicke, who directed Lords of Dogtown, was hired by Winters to work on Thrashin' as a production designer where she met, worked with and befriended many famous skaters including the real Alva, Hawk, Hosoi and Caballero.
                Skateboarding was, at first, tied to the culture of surfing. As skateboarding spread across the United States to places unfamiliar with surfing or surfer culture, it developed an image of its own. For example, the classic film short Video Days (1991) portrayed skateboarders as "reckless rebels".
                California duo Jan and Dean recorded the song "Sidewalk Surfin'" in 1964, which is the Beach Boys song "Catch a Wave" with new lyrics associated with skateboarding instead of surfing.</p>
